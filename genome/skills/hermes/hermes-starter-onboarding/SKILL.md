# Hermes Starter Onboarding

## Overview

Use this skill to turn a blank or lightly configured Hermes profile into a setup chosen by its owner. The workflow is conversational and consent-gated: learn the user's identity and priorities, recommend a small capability bundle, show the proposed changes, apply only what the user approves, and verify the result.

This is a **capability planner**, not a blind installer. A Hermes toolset exposes a capability, a skill provides operating instructions, a plugin or MCP server provides an integration, and a desktop application such as Obsidian is a separate dependency. Explain that distinction in plain language when it matters.

The setup must work for a public starter profile. Never assume the user's name, location, timezone, businesses, accounts, vault paths, tickers, health history, credentials, or preferred assistant name. Ask instead.

## When to Use

- A new user starts a Donna or other Hermes starter profile.
- The user says "set me up," "configure my assistant," "what tools should I enable," or asks what Hermes can connect to.
- The user wants to choose memory, notes, browser, terminal, voice, calendar, reminders, email, or other integrations.
- The user asks to add or change a daily briefing, daily wellness check-in, recurring health reminder, or stock-quote schedule.
- The user asks to review or change an existing starter setup.

**Don't use for:**

- Installing Hermes itself or repairing the Hermes runtime; use `hermes-agent`.
- Diagnosing an already configured integration; load the matching integration or troubleshooting skill.
- Making medical decisions, diagnosing symptoms, or monitoring an emergency.
- Placing trades, giving personalized investment advice, or treating a quote as a trading signal.
- Creating a cron job from an incomplete request when the delivery destination, schedule, or content would be ambiguous.

## Operating Rules

1. Ask one small group of related questions at a time. Do not present a forty-item questionnaire.
2. Start with the user's goals, then recommend capabilities. Do not ask users to choose toolset names they have never seen.
3. Explain what will happen before it happens. No installation, account connection, credential request, or persistent cron creation without explicit approval.
4. Never ask the user to paste a password, API key, OAuth code, payment information, or private token into chat. Use the provider's official setup flow and pause at the credential gate.
5. Read-only discovery is allowed before approval when it does not access private account content. Do not silently read connected accounts, note vaults, calendars, mailboxes, or health records.
6. Keep setup choices local to the active profile. Do not edit another Hermes profile or global configuration unless the user explicitly requests that scope.
7. After a persistent toolset or provider change, tell the user whether a new session or gateway restart is required. Do not claim a new tool is available until a fresh-process check confirms it.
8. A cron job runs in a fresh session with no current-chat context. Every LLM-driven cron prompt must be self-contained.
9. **Run the orientation in the live session — do not delegate it to a sub-agent.** Onboarding is a conversation: each answer shapes the next question, and the setup actions (a `config set`, a toolset toggle) are instant. Spawning a sub-agent to "set things up in the background" would sever that loop and add indirection, not reduce derailment. Keep it single-threaded and interactive.
10. Do not put memory writes in cron prompts. Mnemosyne is provider-injected, not a toolset, and cron contexts intentionally skip Mnemosyne tools. Health responses must not be stored automatically.
11. Never use `enabled_toolsets: ["mnemosyne"]`; that is not a valid configuration. Use the `memory` provider setup for memory and the `cronjob` tool for schedules.

## Phase 0 — Inspect Before Changing Anything

Before proposing changes, inspect only the active profile:

1. Use `hermes config get onboarding` if the CLI supports the key. If it is absent, do not treat that as an error; the profile can still use this skill.
2. Use `hermes memory status` to identify the active memory provider and whether it is installed.
3. Use `hermes tools` to view the current toolset selection. This is the supported interactive toolset configuration surface; do not hand-edit a nested toolset list merely to avoid the selector.
4. Call `cronjob(action="list")` before creating any recurring job. Look for existing jobs with the same purpose, schedule, or name.
5. If the user mentions a specific integration, inspect the installed skill inventory with `skills_list()` or search the active profile's `skills/` directory. Do not assume that a desktop application or account is installed because a skill exists.

Report the starting state briefly. Do not dump credentials, full environment files, private account data, or the entire skill library.

## Phase 1 — Ask the Human Questions

Use this order, adapting to answers already given.

**Do not stop after the identity answers.** Work through every group below in one continuous pass — Identity → Main jobs → Memory → Notes → Capability boundaries → Toolset walkthrough — feeding each answer into the next. Do not pause to ask "should I continue?" and do not wrap up after the first couple of answers. The setup plan comes at the end (Phase 2), not after the first question group. Completing only the identity questions is an abandoned onboarding, not a finished one.

### Identity

Ask:

- "What should I call you?"
- "What would you like to call me?"
- "Do you prefer concise, conversational, formal, or highly detailed replies?"

If the user skips a question, use a neutral default and say what was assumed. Store identity and style only in the active profile after approval; do not write them into the public package.

### Main jobs

Ask what the assistant is mainly for. Offer plain-language choices:

- Research and current web answers
- Writing and documents
- Personal organization and reminders
- Notes and knowledge management
- Coding and technical work
- Local files and computer tasks
- Voice conversations
- Business or professional workflows

The user may choose more than one. All toolsets are already enabled by default in this profile, so the goal is to confirm what they'll use and peel back the rest — not to build up from nothing.

### Memory

Ask whether the user already has a memory provider set up:

> "Do you already have a memory provider configured — Mnemosyne, Honcho, Mem0, or something else — or should I set one up?"

- **If they have one (or want to pick their own):** run `hermes memory setup` and let them authenticate through the provider's own flow. Do not switch providers silently.
- **If they don't (or are unsure):** recommend **Mnemosyne** — it is the provider this profile's skills are written around (`hermes-mnemosyne`, `mnemosyne-maintenance`), it is profile-scoped and local-first, and it needs no external account. Offer to set it up:
  - enable profile memory with `hermes config set memory.memory_enabled true` and `hermes config set memory.provider mnemosyne`,
  - verify with `hermes memory status`.
  - Keep Mnemosyne data profile-scoped; do not expose it as a cron toolset.
- **If they prefer no persistent memory:** disable it with `hermes config set memory.memory_enabled false`.

If Mnemosyne is unavailable on their install, report that exact status and offer the supported setup path (`hermes plugins install mnemosyne` or `hermes setup plugins`); do not invent a package name or installation command.

### Notes and Obsidian

Ask:

> "Do you already use Obsidian or another notes system?"

If yes, ask which system and, for Obsidian, which vault the user wants to connect. Do not read the vault before the user identifies and approves it. Check whether the corresponding skill is already present with `skills_list()`.

- If the skill is bundled, enable/use it; do not reinstall a copy.
- If it is missing, show the exact skill name and ask before running `hermes skills install <name>`.
- Installing or enabling a skill does not install the Obsidian desktop application.
- Treat the vault path as private profile configuration, never as a package default.

### Capability boundaries

Ask only about capabilities relevant to the user's goals:

- **Web research:** web search and source retrieval.
- **Browser automation:** website interaction; explain that browser access is broader than web search.
- **Local files:** read and write files in approved locations.
- **Terminal:** run local commands; explain that this is a higher-trust capability.
- **Voice:** speech recognition and/or text-to-speech, subject to provider setup.
- **Calendar, reminders, email, or other accounts:** connect only the specific service requested, with the user completing authentication.

For persistent toolset changes, use `hermes tools` rather than guessing a configuration key. For a one-off session, use the documented `hermes chat --toolsets "web,terminal"` form when appropriate instead of changing the profile.

### Toolset walkthrough — confirm what's on, peel back what they don't need

Every CLI toolset is **already enabled by default** in this profile, so the profile works out of the box the way a fully configured reference setup does. The walkthrough is not an install step — it is a **review**: tell the user everything is already on, then walk each toolset in plain language and ask whether they want to keep it or turn it off. Peel back only what they decline; leave the rest enabled.

First, show the current state so the user sees that everything is on:

```bash
hermes tools
```

Then walk the enabled set. For each, say what it's for and ask: "Keep <name> on, or turn it off?" Default to keeping it on if they're unsure.

| Toolset | Plain-language purpose |
|---|---|
| `web` | Web search and fetching page content. Needs a search backend (below). |
| `browser` | Drive a real browser: click, fill forms, log into sites. Broader than `web`. |
| `terminal` | Run shell commands. Higher-trust; explain the risk before enabling. |
| `file` | Read and write local files. |
| `code_execution` | Run Python for data work, calculations, multi-step scripts. |
| `computer_use` | Drive the desktop GUI in the background (click apps, screenshots). macOS. |
| `memory` | Remember preferences and facts across conversations. |
| `session_search` | Search past conversations. |
| `delegation` | Spawn sub-agents for parallel or specialist work. |
| `skills` | Load reusable procedures (the skills in this profile). |
| `cronjob` | Scheduled/recurring tasks (briefings, reminders). |
| `todo` | Track multi-step tasks within a session. |
| `kanban` | Durable multi-session task boards for longer projects. |
| `image_gen` | Generate images from text. Needs an image backend/key. |
| `video_gen` | Generate short video clips. Needs a video backend/key. |
| `vision` | Read images the user shares. |
| `tts` | Text-to-speech voice output. Needs a TTS provider/key. |
| `video` | Analyze video files. |
| `clarify` | Ask the user structured multiple-choice questions mid-task. |

Apply the approved adjustments through `hermes tools` — since everything starts enabled, this usually means turning off only the toolsets the user declined. Some toolsets only appear there when their dependency is present (an API key, a backend, a driver) — if a toolset the user wants is missing from the list, say so and move to its setup step rather than pretending it is enabled.

#### Web search backend (required for `web` to return results)

`web` needs a search provider. This is a **global** Hermes setting, not profile config — set it once and every profile uses it. Ask the user which they have:

- **Self-hosted SearXNG** — private, free, no key. Ask for *their* instance URL, then configure the web-search backend to use it. Never hardcode or assume an instance address.
- **A hosted search API** (Brave, Tavily, Exa, etc.) — ask them to complete the provider's own key flow; never take the key in chat.
- **Not sure** — point them to `hermes setup`, which walks the search-backend choice interactively.

Verify with a real query afterward (e.g. `web_search("Hermes Agent")`) and confirm results come back before calling it working.

#### Provider / model

Confirm the model provider works end-to-end. The profile defaults to `deepseek`; if the user uses another provider, set it and run one real chat turn to confirm the key is valid. Do not ship or assume any specific API key.

**Reusing providers the user already configured.** Many newcomers ran `hermes setup` once before cloning this profile, so a working provider and API key may already exist in their **default** profile or global config. Ask first — "Do you already have a model provider working in another Hermes profile?" — and offer to bring it over instead of making them re-enter a key:

- **API keys live in `.env`, not config.yaml.** A profile reads its own `~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/.env` first, then falls back to the global `~/.hermes/.env`. If the key is already in the global `.env`, this profile picks it up automatically — nothing to copy. Only add a profile-local `.env` when the user wants a *different* key for this profile than the global one.
- **Never ask them to paste the key into chat.** Point them to where it already is, or have them run `hermes setup` / edit `.env` themselves. Read-only confirmation that a key is *present* (e.g. `hermes auth list`) is fine; do not print the value.
- **Provider/model selection is config, not a secret.** Set `hermes --profile donna config set model.provider <provider>` and `model.default <model>` to match whatever already works, then verify with one real chat turn.
- **Copying provider *settings* between profiles is fine; copying *credentials* is not something the agent does for them.** If they want the same custom-provider block (base_url, etc.) that exists in their default profile, walk them through re-adding it here with `hermes config set` rather than editing another profile's files — keeping with the rule that setup stays local to the active profile.

#### Optional integrations with their own setup

Some capabilities need more than a toolset toggle. Offer each and pause at its credential/permission gate:

- **Voice** (`tts`, and speech recognition if wanted) — needs a voice provider.
- **Image/video generation** — needs the matching backend key.
- **Calendar / reminders / email** — connect only the specific service requested, user completes auth.
- **Browser automation** — needs a browser backend available on the machine.

## Phase 2 — Present the Setup Plan

Before applying anything, show a compact plan in this shape:

```text
Proposed setup

Identity:
- Call you: <name>
- Call me: <assistant name>
- Reply style: <style>

Capabilities:
- Enable: <plain-language capabilities>
- Leave off: <capabilities not selected>

Memory:
- <off / local persistent / selected provider>

Integrations:
- <Obsidian, calendar, reminders, voice, or none>

Scheduled jobs:
- <daily briefing / wellness check-in / recurring health reminder / stock quotes / none>
- Delivery: <origin chat or explicitly selected destination>
- Timezone: <timezone>

I will not install applications, connect accounts, or create recurring jobs until you approve this plan.
```

A clear response such as "yes," "apply it," or an equivalent approval is required before applying persistent changes. If the user changes one item, revise the plan and request approval again.

## Phase 3 — Apply and Verify

Apply only the approved items, in this order:

1. Identity and style in the active profile.
2. Memory choice with `hermes config set` or `hermes memory setup`.
3. Approved skill or integration setup, pausing at all credential and permission gates.
4. Toolset selection through `hermes tools` if a persistent capability change is required.
5. Existing cron inventory with `cronjob(action="list")`.
6. New or updated scheduled jobs using the templates below.
7. A final readback and concise status report.

After each action, verify its actual result:

- Config changes: read the relevant non-secret key back with `hermes config get <key>`.
- Memory: run `hermes memory status`; if Mnemosyne is selected, verify the active profile's provider status and data location without printing secrets.
- Skills: call `skills_list()` or `hermes skills list` and confirm the exact skill name.
- Toolsets: reopen `hermes tools` or start a fresh session and verify the capability is present.
- Cron: use `cronjob(action="list")` and confirm the exact name, schedule, prompt purpose, and delivery target. Do not treat a returned job ID alone as proof that a job will deliver.

If a change requires a new session, say `New session required` rather than pretending the current context has reloaded it.

## Scheduled Setup Options

These are optional jobs. They are not created by default.

### Daily briefing

Ask for:

- Delivery time and timezone.
- Whether it should run every day or weekdays.
- Sections wanted: calendar/agenda if connected, reminders/tasks, weather if a location is provided, current news, local events, and/or selected stock quotes.
- Delivery destination. Omit `deliver` for the normal origin destination; never guess a chat ID.

The briefing prompt must say:

- Use only sources and integrations that are actually available.
- Clearly label unavailable sections instead of fabricating them.
- Cite or link current sources for news and market data.
- Keep the result concise unless the user requests detail.
- Do not expose account contents beyond the requested summary.

Example creation call after approval:

```python
cronjob(
 action="create",
 schedule="0 8 * * *",
 name="Daily Briefing",
 prompt="""You are running the user's scheduled daily briefing. It is <weekday or every day> at <time> in <IANA timezone>. Produce a concise briefing with only these approved sections: <sections>. Use configured integrations only when they are available and authorized. Use web search for current news or weather only when needed, and include source links and the retrieval date/time. If a section is unavailable, say so plainly rather than guessing. Do not write memories or ask for credentials. Do not provide financial or medical advice. Deliver only the final briefing.""",
 enabled_toolsets=["web"]
)
```

Use `enabled_toolsets=["web"]` only when the user selected current web content. Add other toolsets only when the installed profile and the approved plan require them. If the user wants a calendar section but has not connected a calendar, create the briefing without that section or pause for explicit integration setup.

### Daily wellness check-in

Offer this as a non-clinical check-in, not as medical monitoring. Ask for:

- Delivery time and timezone.
- Every day or weekdays.
- Whether the message should ask about sleep, energy/mood, movement, hydration, or a user-supplied wellness goal.

Use a short, low-pressure prompt. Do not include the user's health history in the cron prompt. Do not automatically save replies to memory. If the user wants longitudinal tracking, ask separately for explicit consent and configure an appropriate health-tracking workflow in a normal session.

Example:

```python
cronjob(
 action="create",
 schedule="0 9 * * *",
 name="Daily Wellness Check-In",
 prompt="""Send a short, supportive daily wellness check-in. Ask only about these approved topics: <sleep, energy, movement, hydration, or goal>. Keep it non-clinical and optional. Do not diagnose, prescribe, infer a condition, or claim to monitor the user's health. Do not write the response to memory. If the user reports an immediate danger or crisis, advise contacting local emergency services or an appropriate crisis/medical professional; do not attempt to manage the emergency. Deliver one concise check-in question or checklist."""
)
```

A health check-in should not use `no_agent=True`; it needs an LLM to phrase the message. It also should not use Mnemosyne tools from the cron context.

### Recurring health reminder

If the user asks for a medication, appointment, exercise, hydration, or other health-related reminder, treat it as a reminder only. Ask for the exact wording, schedule, timezone, and destination. Do not infer medication names, doses, diagnoses, or treatment plans. The reminder must state only what the user explicitly supplied.

Example:

```python
cronjob(
 action="create",
 schedule="<approved schedule>",
 name="Health Reminder - <neutral label>",
 prompt="Deliver this exact user-approved reminder: <exact wording>. Do not add medical advice, dosage instructions, or a diagnosis. If the user asks a medical question in response, answer only with general safety guidance and recommend a qualified clinician when appropriate."
)
```

Do not put sensitive details in a job name when a neutral label will work. The job definition is stored locally and may be visible to anyone who can read the profile's cron configuration.

### Stock quotes

Ask for:

- Exact ticker symbols and exchanges when ambiguity is possible.
- Currency preference.
- Delivery time and timezone.
- Every day or weekdays.
- Whether the quotes belong in the daily briefing or should be a separate message.

Validate the ticker list before creating the job. Do not infer a ticker from a company name when multiple listings are plausible; ask. Use web search or an explicitly configured market-data integration at run time. Every quote message must include the source, retrieval date/time, and whether the data is delayed. If a source is unavailable, report that rather than filling in a number.

Example:

```python
cronjob(
 action="create",
 schedule="0 16 * * 1-5",
 name="Stock Quotes",
 prompt="""Provide the user's scheduled quote summary for these exact listings: <ticker/exchange list>. Use an available current web or market-data source. Report the quote, currency, source link, retrieval date/time, and any delayed-data notice. If any listing cannot be verified, say so and omit the number. Do not fabricate prices, predict movements, recommend trades, or present this as financial advice. Do not write memories or request credentials in the cron message. Deliver a concise table.""",
 enabled_toolsets=["web"]
)
```

Stock quotes may be attached to the daily briefing instead of creating a separate job. If the user selects both, ask whether they want one combined message or two scheduled messages; do not create duplicates.

## Managing Existing Jobs

Before creating a job, call:

```python
cronjob(action="list")
```

If an equivalent job exists:

- Ask whether to keep, update, pause, or remove it.
- Use the exact returned job ID when names are ambiguous.
- Use `cronjob(action="update", job_id="<id>", ...)` for an approved change.
- Use `cronjob(action="pause", job_id="<id>")` to stop delivery without deleting history.
- Use `cronjob(action="resume", job_id="<id>")` to restart a paused job.
- Use `cronjob(action="remove", job_id="<id>")` only after explicit approval because removal deletes the schedule.

After creating or updating a job, use `cronjob(action="list")` again. For a first-run smoke test, use `cronjob(action="run", job_id="<id>")` only when the user explicitly requests an immediate test; the real schedule is not proven until a completed execution appears in the cron history.

Cron schedules use the configured host/gateway timezone unless the deployment supports an explicit timezone field. If the user's timezone differs from the host timezone and the scheduler has no per-job timezone support, explain the limitation and convert only after the user approves the resulting local schedule. Never silently shift a reminder by hours.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Double onboarding:** Hermes already has a built-in `onboarding.profile_build: ask` first-touch offer. Let that handle the consent-gated profile-build offer, then use this skill for capability and schedule choices. Do not create a second competing first-run identity interview. The internal `onboarding.seen` state is managed by Hermes; do not hand-edit it.

2. **Treating a skill as an application installer:** A bundled Obsidian skill does not install Obsidian. Confirm the app and vault separately, and never read a vault before approval.

3. **Creating duplicate crons:** Cron jobs run in fresh sessions and do not remember that a similar job was created earlier. Always call `cronjob(action="list")` first and compare purpose, schedule, and destination.

4. **Using memory in cron:** Mnemosyne is not a valid toolset and is intentionally skipped in cron contexts. Do not promise that a wellness response was remembered. Offer an explicit normal-session tracking setup instead.

5. **Fabricating current information:** Stock quotes, news, weather, calendar data, and market status are time-sensitive. Use an available source at run time, include source/time, and report unavailable data.

6. **Cron approval confusion:** The starter profile may retain `approvals.cron_mode: deny`. That setting blocks dangerous commands in headless cron runs; it is not a reason to enable unsafe approval mode. Do not change it to `approve` merely to make a web-based briefing work.

7. **Credential leakage:** Never place API keys, tokens, OAuth codes, or full account contents in a cron prompt, job name, response, skill file, or package artifact.

8. **Medical overreach:** A daily health cron is a reminder or voluntary wellness check-in, not a clinician, emergency monitor, medication manager, or diagnostic system.

9. **Assuming the current session sees changes:** Toolset and skill discovery can be cached. Verify with a fresh session or an explicit listing command before reporting the capability as active.
